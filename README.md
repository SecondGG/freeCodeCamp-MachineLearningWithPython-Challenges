# Machine Learning with Python Course Projects

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges from the "[Machine Learning with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python)" course provided by freeCodeCamp. Throughout the course, I've delved into a variety of machine learning concepts, from fundamental models to advanced techniques, using the TensorFlow framework. The course covered everything from basic linear regression and classification to more complex topics like convolutional neural networks, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

I am grateful to freeCodeCamp for providing this comprehensive and insightful machine learning course. The challenges and projects enabled me to gain hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of various machine learning techniques.

## Course Overview
In this course, I gained proficiency in the following areas:

- **Basic Machine Learning Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Classification
  - Clustering
- **Advanced Topics Explored**:
  - Neural Networks
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Deep Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning
  - Projects Completed

## Throughout the course, I successfully completed the following machine learning projects:

### 1. [Cat and Dog Image Classifier](https://github.com/SecondGG/freeCodeCamp-MachineLearningWithPython-Challenges/blob/main/fcc_cat_dog_image_classification.ipynb)
In this project, I designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model's training and validation were carried out using TensorFlow, and the resulting model can effectively distinguish between these two popular pet categories.

### 2. [Book Recommendation Engine using KNN](https://github.com/SecondGG/freeCodeCamp-MachineLearningWithPython-Challenges/blob/main/fcc_book_recommendation_using_knn.ipynb)
For this project, I undertook the task of building a Book Recommendation Engine. After preprocessing the dataset, I constructed a K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to provide personalized book recommendations based on user preferences.

### 3. [Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator](https://github.com/SecondGG/freeCodeCamp-MachineLearningWithPython-Challenges/blob/main/fcc_predict_health_costs_with_regression.ipynb)
Here, I leveraged linear regression to develop a model capable of predicting healthcare expenses. Through data analysis and feature engineering, I created a model that can estimate the costs associated with health treatments.

### 4. [Neural Network SMS Text Classifier](https://github.com/SecondGG/freeCodeCamp-MachineLearningWithPython-Challenges/blob/main/fcc_sms_text_classification.ipynb)
In this project, I implemented a neural network model for sentiment classification of SMS messages. By training the model on a labeled dataset, it can effectively differentiate between legitimate messages ("ham") and spam messages.
